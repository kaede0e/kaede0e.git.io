								<h2>About me</h2>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/IMG_0528.jpg" alt="" /></span>My name is Kaede Hirabayashi (she/her).
									I'm a MSc student in Dr. Greg Owens lab at University of Victoria,
									currently working on the thesis to study genomic diversity and evolution of lingonberry (Vaccinium vitis-idaea).
									My research interest is driven by (broadly) biodiversity conservation,
									which directed me to study plants whom all of us as humans and other terrestrial organisms rely on to live but we know too little about.
									I am fascinated by how plants, the sessile organisms, sense the surrounding and respond by manipulating the chemistry they perform.
									As a plant molecular biologist, I aspire to contribute to preserve biodiversity in the face of changing climate.<br />
									When I'm not studying, you can find me taking landscape photos, listening to classical music, strolling in the park, cooking, baking, or dancing ballet. </p>
